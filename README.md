## Location Recommendation System for New Businesses in Budapest, Hungary

### Introduction

In the project below I try to help people who want to found a new business or expand their existing one in Budapest, Hungary. 

One important element of starting an successful business is finding the best location of it. It is well known that similar businesses tend to gravitate to each other, creating clusters of them all around the city. If you open your new shop close to your competitors, you have higher chance that people will find and try it just by chance.

The user of the recommendation system can enter a category as an input, e.g. "Coffee Shop", "Restaurant", "Bookstore", etc. and the system will determine the best location of a new venue based on the distribution of the already existing ones.
